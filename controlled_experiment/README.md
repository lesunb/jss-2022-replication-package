# Controlled Experiments

This is the documentation generated for **repeating** the controlled experiments and analysis to perform the evaluation goal 1 "Evaluate whether MissionControl promotes effec-
tive mission coordination of cooperative heterogeneous robots".

## Overview

```
    |--- morse_simulation : automated tooling for executing the controlled experiments
    |--- dataset
    |--- analysis_scripts
    |--- results
```

## Note
- The `morse_simulation` package uses as input the json file generated by `mission_control`. The json file needs to be moved to the base directory of `morse_simulation`.
- Each `morse_simulation` run executes the 81 generated scenarios. To macth the same ammout of executions registered in the dataset dir, the user needs to execute `morse_simulation` eight times.
